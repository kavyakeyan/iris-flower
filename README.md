Iris Flower Classification Project
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification model using the famous Iris Flower Dataset. The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning and data analysis.

Dataset
The Iris Dataset is a small dataset consisting of 150 observations and 4 features:

sepal length
sepal width
petal length
petal width
Each sample in the dataset also includes a label, which is the flower species.

Project Steps
Data Loading and Preparation

Load the dataset using Pandas and assign column names.
Split the data into features (X) and target labels (y).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize relationships between features and target classes using pair plots.
Check for any missing values and examine data types.
Model Training

Use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to create a simple classification model.
Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).
Train the model on the training set.
Evaluation

Make predictions on the test set and calculate the model’s accuracy.
Display the accuracy score.
Saving the Model

Save the trained model using joblib to allow for reuse without retraining.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

pandas
seaborn

How to Run
Set up the environment: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Load the data: Use the provided CSV file or download it from the UCI ML Repository.
Run the code cells: Follow each step as shown in the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file.
Results
This project should produce a simple KNN model with a reasonable accuracy score (usually above 90%) for classifying the Iris flower species.

Files
Iris Dataset file: iris.data
Jupyter Notebook: Contains the code for loading, analyzing, training, evaluating, and saving the model.
Future Improvements
Experiment with other machine learning models, such as SVM or Decision Trees.
Implement hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
Integrate cross-validation to test the model more rigorously.
